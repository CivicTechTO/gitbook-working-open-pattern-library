# Pattern: Private Resource Inventory {#Pattern-Private-Resource-Inventory}

This is a document, ideally in a prominent location \(like the top level of a shared Google folder\). It can be called something self-explanatory like “List of Privileged Resources”. This documents which resources are kept privileged, who manages them, and why they are privileged. This helps ensure:

* the existence of private resources are legible to everyone \(so long as that’s not detrimental\),
* there is a specific person who can easily be approached for access and questions about privileged resources
