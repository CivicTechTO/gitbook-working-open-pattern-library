# Pattern: Call-Out Box

#### Examples

* [EDGI Archiving/Technical Working Group Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LgeB_2SBdxecKlKtDjH1scuOrCl-O0pAcly-Xy9Plr0/edit#heading=h.jkj1nyib8wf1)

#### Related Patterns

* Great candidates for call-out box content:
  * An explanation of [CONSENSUS-BASED EDITING](/google-drive-consensus-based-editing.md) of the document.
  * A [CLEAR TIMELINE](/process-clear-timelines.md) of phases a document will go through.
* Each box can have a BACKLINK to the pattern that rationalizes its content.
