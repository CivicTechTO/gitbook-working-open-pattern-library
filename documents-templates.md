* Common way: copy document from last one.
  * Results in unintentional drift. Particularly important when tasks shared by many, as fewer people hold the history in their minds, to know what's being lost.
  * "You can't remove the fence across the path until you know why it was placed there to begin with." -- city planning anecdote
* Templates allow process to be embedded in docs, and to persist.
* The bounds of "rigid" process can be confined only to templates, and not be overbearing on the day-to-day workings of the group.
